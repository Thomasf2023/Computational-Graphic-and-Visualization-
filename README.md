This repository includes my final project for my Computer Graphic and Visualization as well as a design logic document.


<h1> Module 8 Portfolio </h1>

<h2> How do I approach designing software? </h2>

The way that I approach designing software is to plan out what I will need in the project and then do an outline of the project. After that, I will start designing the other things that I will need like classes, etc. By deisgn, I mean that I will be creating diagrams of the classes and what they will need to function properly. My favorite way to do this is through UML diagrams for classes. The way that I work is from larger to smaller, I start with the large picture and then dive into the details when outlining. 

The new designs skills that I picked up from this course was organization. My code needed to be organized in the right way in order for it to work properly. The includes were espcially important with this. The project had to be set up and organized the right way or else it would not run.

The design process that I followed was the same that I follow for all of my projects. Start with the large picture, what needs to be included, and then dive into the details. I started with the idea of what my 3d scene needed to look like. What helped was that I looked at what the final project requirements were on the first day of class, this gave me a very good sense of what was needed, even if I didn't know yet how to implment it. This gave me a list of things that I would need to include in the final project and then throughout the course as I learned more, I was able to include into the outline ways that I can implement what is needed.

The organization will for sure be applied to my future work. One thing that I started doing in this project was to keep track of everything that I added in the milestone, at the top of the cpp file in comments. This really helped me when I needed to look back at something because I could look at my comments, say "okay I did this in module X" then I could go back to that module and reread resources.

<h2> How do I approach developing programs? </h2>

I approach developing programs the same way that I approach developing software. The reason for this is because I think that this stragety works very well and also has a lot of reprocity for figuring out and designing differnt things. I always start with the higher concepts and then fill out the details after. I make a plan of what I want to do, usually an outline, and fill it out as I learn more. 

The way that Iteration factored into development was to allow the user to move around the scene. There was also an assignment where a light would rotate around an object, iteration was important to this because it made the light rotate. Without loops or iteration this would be impossible. My approach elvolved through the milestones because I learned more and more through each resource and was able to apply that to the project and to differnt assignments. 


<h2> How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? </h2>

What computational graphics and visualization has taught me is what goes into making graphics on a computer or in a program. It gave me an insight into designing these graphics and gave me the opprotunity to learn about it and experiment with it myself. This means that when it is needed for me to apply this knowledge again, I will be able to.
